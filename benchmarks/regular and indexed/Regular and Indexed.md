Thanks for sharing the benchmark results! Based on the image, it's clear how the operations compare between IndexedDB and SQLite (WASM), both with and without indexing, across 100,000 operations.

### Key Observations:
- **INSERT and UPDATE**:
  - IndexedDB performs faster than SQLite WASM for large-scale `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations.
  - With indexing, IndexedDB is slightly slower but still maintains a good performance.
  - SQLite WASM performs slower overall for these operations, and indexing in SQLite WASM seems to add even more overhead.

- **SELECT**:
  - SQLite WASM absolutely outperforms IndexedDB for `SELECT` operations.
  - IndexedDB is significantly slower without indexing, but indexing speeds it up considerably.
  - With or without indexing, SQLite WASM has near-instant response times for `SELECT` operations.

- **DELETE**:
  - IndexedDB performs decently, and indexing adds a bit of overhead.
  - SQLite WASM is lightning fast for `DELETE`, both with and without indexing, practically taking no time.

### Insights:
- **IndexedDB** is more suited for `INSERT` and `UPDATE` operations, especially when dealing with large amounts of data, but it lags behind in `SELECT` operations unless an index is used.
- **SQLite WASM** excels at read operations (`SELECT`) and `DELETE`, but has some overhead for writes like `INSERT` and `UPDATE`.

The results help illustrate the trade-offs between the two storage systems and provide clear insights into when to use IndexedDB or SQLite WASM based on the operation being performed.

Is there anything you would like to adjust or further explore with these benchmarks?
